      <p> 1. There are so many lovely independent cafes and coffee shops
        that you should ignore all the chains. Here are some of our faves:</p>

      <p> 2. There is so much free comedy in the city centre- check out
        The International, The Duke, and The Stag's Head for some good fun
        evening comedy. </p>

      <p> 3. If you're going to jaywalk, do it when the locals do. </p>

      <p> 4. Kitty has missed Greggs since she arrived, but has found a
        good substitute- The Green Bench Cafe does fantastic sausage rolls.
        (No Â£2 coffee and sausage roll deal though.) </p>

      <p> 5. There are two O'Connell Bridges. The main one, and a second one
        in Stephen's Green. </p>
