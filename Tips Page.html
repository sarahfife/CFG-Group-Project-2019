      <h1> Dublin Tips </h1>
      <p> 1. There are so many lovely independent cafes and coffee shops
        that you should ignore all the chains. Here are some of our faves:
<ul class = "tips">
  <li> Two pups </li>
  <li> Tang </li>
  <li> Wuff </li>
  <li> Shoe lane </li>
  <li> Accents </li>
</ul>
      </p>

      <p> 2. There is so much free comedy in the city centre - check out
        The International, The Duke, and The Stag's Head for some good fun
        evening comedy. </p>

      <p> 3. If you're going to jaywalk, do it when the locals do (love Sarah) </p>

      <p> 4. Kitty has missed Greggs since she arrived, but has found a
        good substitute - The Green Bench Cafe does fantastic sausage rolls.
        (No Â£2 coffee and sausage roll deal though.) </p>

      <p> 5. There are two O'Connell Bridges. The main one, and a second one
        in Stephen's Green. </p>
