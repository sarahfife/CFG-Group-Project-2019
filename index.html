<h1> A non-Dubs' guide to the Auld Shmoke </h1>
<h2>  (with some help from an actual Dub) </h2>

      <p> Hello fellow non-Dubs, welcome to our site!
        We are two non-Dub, non-Irish, one non-European (soon to be two) girls who moved
        to Dublin for work (and play) and were joined by a Dub for this project. </p>

        <p> We know how tricky it can be to navigate a new city, so we have put
          together some fun facts and tips to help you on your way. Luckily, we
          have one dub on our site who can verify these fab facts and tips!

          So... who are we?
